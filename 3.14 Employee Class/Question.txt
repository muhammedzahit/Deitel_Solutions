3.14 (Employee Class) Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as
data members—a first name (type string), a last name (type string) and a monthly salary (type
int). [Note: In subsequent chapters, we’ll use numbers that contain decimal points (e.g., 2.75)—
called floating-point values—to represent dollar amounts.] Your class should have a constructor that
initializes the three data members. Provide a set and a get function for each data member. If the
monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0. Write a test program that demonstrates class Employee’s
capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object’s yearly salary. Then give each 
Employee a 10 percent raise and display each Employee’s yearly salary again.
