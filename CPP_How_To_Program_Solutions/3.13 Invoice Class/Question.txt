3.13 (Invoice Class) Create a class called Invoice that a hardware store might use to represent
an invoice for an item sold at the store. An Invoice should include four data members—a part number (type string),
a part description (type string), a quantity of the item being purchased (typeint) and a price per item (type int).
Your class should have a constructor that initializes the four data members. A constructor that receives multiple
arguments is defined with the form:

ClassName( TypeName1 parameterName1, TypeName2 parameterName2, ... )

Provide a set and a get function for each data member. In addition, provide a member function
named getInvoiceAmount that calculates the invoice amount (i.e., multiplies the quantity by the
price per item), then returns the amount as an int value. If the quantity is not positive, it should be
set to 0. If the price per item is not positive, it should be set to 0. Write a test program that demonstrates 
class Invoice’s capabilities.
